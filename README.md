# World-data

Where am I:

I need to build the basic architecture of my application.
So need to ask chatGPT this question:

"I have an android app that present a list of countries.
How the architecture of this app should look like?
take into account that I (with a server) should have the ability to update this list (but not frequently)"

and build all the relevant components.



I took the flags from here:
