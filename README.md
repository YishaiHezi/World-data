# World-data

Where am I:

I'm in the middle of building the basic architecture of my application.
it should contain a data layer, UI layer, and maybe domain layer (in the middle).

- So I'm in the middle of building the data layer. I Need to add logic to the repository, to be able to
  call the server if the DB is empty (in the first installation) or if the DB need an update.

- Also, I need to populate the DB with initial data. Need to understand how to get the data from world bank and insert it to the DB.



I took the flags from here:
