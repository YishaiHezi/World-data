# World-data

Where am I:

- I want to create a quiz. that is what I do in the quiz branch.

- I want to show every country's location on a map in the country activity. that is what I do in the maps branch.


*In the future:*
- I Need to add logic to the repository, to be able to call the server if the DB is empty (in the first installation) or if the DB need an update.




*Bugs:*
- to fix: why I don't have GDP data on Qatar?

- to fix: the shadow around Nepal flag.

- to fix: These countries doesn't have a coat of arms: (need to find a solution)
Puerto Rico (PR)
American Samoa (AS)
Sint Maarten (SX)
Eswatini (SZ)
Saint Martin (MF)
Northern Mariana Islands (MP)
United States Virgin Islands (VI)
