# World-data

Where am I:

I'm in the middle of building the basic architecture of my application.
it should contain a data layer, UI layer, and maybe domain layer (in the middle).

- So I'm in the middle of building the data layer. I Need to add logic to the repository, to be able to
  call the server if the DB is empty (in the first installation) or if the DB need an update.

- Also, I need to add a button or a scroller for the user to select the parameter in the country rating fragment.



I took the flags from here:
